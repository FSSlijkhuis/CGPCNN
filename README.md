# CGPCNN
A notebook which uses Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to evolve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Details on how to do a single run with the CGPCNN and change its paramaters are inside the notebook. An example run is also provided, which is shown within the notebook, as outputs of the cells.
